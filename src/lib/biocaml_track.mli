(** Track files in UCSC Genome Browser format. The following documentation assumes knowledge of concepts explained on the UCSC Genome Browser's website. Basically, a track file is one of several types of data (WIG, GFF, etc.), possibly preceded by comments, browser lines, and a track line. This module allows only a single data track within a file, although the UCSC specifies that multiple tracks may be provided together. *)

(** Track lines define display attributes. They can be thought of as lists of attribute-value pairs. For forward compatibility, this module allows arbitrary attributes to be set. However, the following lists known attributes and specifies restrictions on their values: 
    - [name] - string enclosed in double quotes if there are spaces; recommended to use only alphanumeric characters and length less than 15 characters but this is not enforced
    - [description] - string enclosed in double quotes if there are spaces; recommended to use only alphanumeric characters and length less than 60 characters but this is not enforced
    - [visibility] - "hide", "dense", "full", "pack", or "squish"; if [type=wiggle_0] then "hide", "dense", or "full"; can also use integer value where 0 = "hide", 1 = "dense", 2 = "full", 3 = "pack", 4 = "squish"
    - [color] - "R,G,B" where each of R, G, and B are integers between 0 and 255
    - [altColor] - "R,G,B" where each of R, G, and B are integers between 0 and 255
    - [itemRgb] - "On" is the only allowed value
    - [useScore] - 0 or 1
    - [group] - string
    - [priority] - integer
    - [autoScale] - "on" or "off"
    - [gridDefault] - "on" or "off"
    - [maxHeightPixels] - "max:default:min" where each of max, default, and min are integers
    - [graphType] - "bar" or "points"
    - [viewLimits] - "lower:upper" where each of lower and upper are integers
    - [yLineMark] - floating point value
    - [yLineOnOff] - "on" or "off"
    - [windowingFunction] - "maximum", "mean", or "minimum"
    - [smoothingWindow] - "off" or an integer between 2 and 16
    - [db] - should be a valid UCSC assembly ID, but currently any string is accepted
    - [offset] - integer
    - [url] - string
    - [htmlUrl] - string
    - [type] - "wiggle_0" is the only value currently supported, leaving this attribute unset handles other track types
