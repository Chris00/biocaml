(** WIG data.
    
    Internal representation of coordinates always assumes the first position on a chromosome is numbered 1. Also, integer ranges are always closed; the range [\[1, 10\]] is the set of integers from 1 to 10 inclusive of 1 and 10. WIG data can be in three formats---bed, variable-step, or fixed-step---and unfortunately each has different conventions as follows:
    - Bed format requires half-open intervals [\[low, high\)] and numbers the first base as 0. Thus 1 is added to the low value when parsing. The line ["chrI 0 10 3.14"] is parsed to [("chrI", 1, 10, 3.14)].
    - Variable-step format numbers the first position 1 and uses closed intervals. Thus no change is required. The line ["1 3.14"] is parsed to [(1, 3.14)].
    - Fixed-step format numbers the first position 1 and uses closed intervals. Thus no change is required. The header line ["fixedStep chrom=chrI start=1 step=100 span=30"] is parsed to [("chrI", 1, 100, 30)].
    
    The inverse is done for printing routines. You are freed from these details if you always use this module to parse and print.
    
    All parsers allow columns (fields) on a line to be separated by any combination of space, tab, or carriage return characters. Printers always separate columns with a single tab. Tag-value pairs must be in the form "tag=value" with no space around the '='.

exception Bad of string

val of_list : pt list -> t
  (** Construct WIG data from given [pt]'s. Raise [Bad] if any [pt]'s are invalid. *)

val to_file : ?fmt:format -> t -> string -> unit
  (** [to_file ~fmt t file] prints [t] to [file]. Printing is in most efficient format possible by default. Optional [fmt] argument forces printing in a specific format. Requesting [VariableStep] or [FixedStep] may raise [Failure] if given data cannot be represented in those formats. *)
