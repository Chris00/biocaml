Biocaml Installation Instructions
=================================

The recommended installation method is to use GODI (not yet implemented),
which automatically downloads and installs for you. The directions
below are needed only if you are not using GODI.

First, make sure you have the following prerequisites:
   
   ocaml (>= 3.12)
   findlib (for installation only)
   extlib
   pcre
   sqlite3
   batteries
   getopt

Assuming you have all the prerequisites installed, compile the code
by typing:

   ocaml setup.ml -configure
or
   ocaml setup.ml -configure --prefix /some/special/location

Then

   make

And install the libraries and executables by typing:

   make install

This last step will require root permission if your ocaml distribution
is installed in a system directory. Finally, to make documentation do:

   make doc

The root of the documentation is doclib.docdir/index.html.
